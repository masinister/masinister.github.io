**Abstract** We study the inoculation game, a game-theoretic abstraction of epidemic containment played on an undirected graph *G*: each player is associated with a node in *G* and can either acquire protection from a contagious process or risk infection. After decisions are made, an infection starts at a random node *v* and propagates through all unprotected nodes reachable from *v*. It is known that the price of anarchy (PoA) in *n*-node graphs can be as large as *\Theta(n)*. Our main result is a tight upper bound of *O(\sqrt{n\Delta})* on the PoA, where *\Delta* is the maximum degree of the graph. Indeed, we provide constructions of graphs with maximum degree *\Delta* for which the PoA is *\Omega(\sqrt{n\Delta})*. We also study additional factors that can reduce the PoA, such as higher thresholds for contagion and varying the costs of becoming infected vs. acquiring protection.
