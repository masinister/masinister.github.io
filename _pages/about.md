I am a **computer scientist** and educator with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I was advised by [Daniel Reichman](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/dreichman). My research explores the theoretical foundations of computation -- in particular, complexity theory, learning theory, and circuit lower bounds -- as well as the mathematical reasoning capabilities of modern AI systems. 

I also work on applied projects in machine learning, including physics-informed models, neuromorphic computing, and the reasoning abilities of large language models. My work has been published in venues such as ISIT, ITCS, TCS, and NeurIPS, and I am currently an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at Clark University.
