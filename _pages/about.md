I am a **theoretical computer science** PhD student at WPI, advised by [Daniel Reichman](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/dreichman). My research generally revolves around [complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory), but my work also includes ideas from [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). I am particularly interested in the intersection between mathematics and AI. I recently had a paper accepted to the [NeurIPS 2024 Workshop MATH-AI](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RtTNbJthjV)!

Before WPI, I completed Bachelor's deegrees in mathematics and computer science at UCONN, where I also attended the [Markov Chains REU](https://markov-chains-reu.math.uconn.edu/research-projects/research-topics/) directed by [Iddo Ben-Ari](https://math.uconn.edu/person/iddo-ben-ari/). I have also interned at [NIWC PAC](https://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil/) and [NRL DC](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/) where I completed research projects in neuromorphic computing and physics-informed machine learning.
